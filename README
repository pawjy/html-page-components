* <button is=command-button>

A |button| element whose |is| attribute value is |command-button|
represents a command button.  (Be aware that this implementation does
not support mutation of |is| attribute; it must be set to a value
before the element's insertion into the document.)

The element must has a |data-selector| attribute.  Its value is a
group of selectors that selects an element in the document.

The element must has a |data-command| attribute whose value is the
name of the command.

When the element is clicked, the command specified by the
|data-command| attribute value of the element selected by the
|data-selector| attribute value is invoked.

A command whose name is /name/ for element /element/ can be defined by
setting these two values:

  element.cbCommands[name]   An object.  It can have any property.
  element[name]  A function.  This is the method implementing the command.
