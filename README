* Files

The |src/page-components.js| file implements elements described in
this document.

The |css/default.css| file describes the default style for these
elements.  Though the file itself is not required to be loaded itself,
some of style rules in the file are effectively required for these
elements rendered as intended.

  <link rel=stylesheet href=css/default.css>
  <script src=src/page-components.js async></script>

* <button is=command-button>

A |button| element whose |is| attribute value is |command-button|
represents a command button.  (Be aware that this implementation does
not support mutation of |is| attribute; it must be set to a value
before the element's insertion into the document.)

The element must has a |data-selector| attribute.  Its value is a
group of selectors that selects an element in the document.

The element must has a |data-command| attribute whose value is the
name of the command.

When the element is clicked, the command specified by the
|data-command| attribute value of the element selected by the
|data-selector| attribute value is invoked.

A command whose name is /name/ for element /element/ can be defined by
setting these two values:

  element.cbCommands[name]   An object.  It can have any property.
  element[name]  A function.  This is the method implementing the command.

* <image-editor>

An |image-editor| element represents an editable image.  Its content
can be one or more |image-layer| elements, representing layers in the
image.  The order of child elements (in tree order) is the layers'
compound order, where an earlier element has smaller z-index.

A *layer* can be an image or a placeholder (which is a transparent
image for the purpose of composition).  A layer has *natural width*,
*natural height*, and *scale factor*.  A |canvas| element is inserted
into a |image-layer| element.  A layer's *computed width* and
*computed height* are natural width and natural height multiplied by
scale factor, respectively.  Layeres are rendered within the image
using computed width and computed height.

Initially, a layer is a placeholder.  The |placeholder| class is set
to the element while it is a placeholder.  If a placeholder layer has
a |useplaceholderui| attribute specified, the user can click the
element to open a user interface to set a image (i.e. manually
invoking the |selectImageFromFile| method).  In addition, the user can
drop an image file to the element to set the image.  When the user is
dragging an image file over the element, the |drop-target| class is
set to the element.

When a layer is *set* to an image, its natural width and natural
height are set to the image's width and height, respectively, and its
scale factor is set to 1.

A layer has *left* and *top*, which are offsets from the left and top
edges of the parent |image-editor| element, respectively.  They are
both initially set to zero.  If a |movable| attribute is specified to
an |image-layer| element, the layer is *movable*.  If a layer is
movable, its left and top can be modified by dragging the layer, or
using keyboard arrow keys.

A layer has an *anchor point*.  Initially, the anchor point of a layer
is the top left corner of the layer.  If an |anchorpoint| attribute is
set to |center|, the anchor point of a layer is the center of the
layer both horizontally and vertically.  When a layer is set to an
image, the layer's left and top are modified appropriately such that
the anchor point of the layer in the parent |image-editor| element is
preserved.

An |image-editor| element has *width* and *height*.  The width is set
to the offset of the rightmost layer's right edge from the left edge
of the element.  The height is set to the offset of the bottommost
layer's bottom edge from the top edge of the element.

An |image-editor| element has these object properties:

  height (read-only)

    The element's height, in pixels.

  width (read-only)

    The element's width, in pixels.

An |image-editor| element has these methods:

  getPNGBlob () : Promise

    Serializes the element as a PNG file.  It returns a promise which
    is fulfilled with a Blob of that file.

  getJPEGBlob () : Promise

    Serializes the element as a JPEG file.  It returns a promise which
    is fulfilled with a Blob of that file.

An |image-layer| element has these object properties:

  left (read-only)

    The layer's left, in pixels.

  top (read-only)

    The layer's top, in pixels.

  height (read-only)

    The layer's computed height, in pixels.

  width (read-only)

    The layer's computed width, in pixels.

An |image-layer| element has these methods:

  selectImageByURL (url : String) : Promise

    Set the layer to an image specified by the URL /url/.  It returns
    a promise which is fulfilled once the image has been loaded.  It
    is rejected if the image cannot be loaded.

  selectImageFromFile () : Promise

    Set the layer to an image for the element by showing a user
    interface to choose a file.  It returns a promise which is
    fulfilled once the image has been loaded.  It is rejected if the
    image cannot be loaded.  This is a |command-button| command.

  startCaptureMode ()

    Starts the element's *camera capture mode*, if not yet and if
    possible.  While the element is in the camera capture mode, a
    |video| element with class |capture| is inserted in the element.
    This is a |command-button| command.

  endCaptureMode ()

    Ends the element's camera capture mode, if the element is in that
    mode.  This is a |command-button| command.

  selectImageFromCaptureModeAndEndCaptureMode () : Promise

    Set the layer to the current snapshot of the camera image.  It
    returns a promise which is fulfilled once the image has been
    loaded.  It is rejected if the image cannot be loaded.  It
    implicitly invokes |endCaptureMode|.  This is a |command-button|
    command.

  rotateClockwise ()

    Set the layer to the result of rotation of the layer π/2 radian
    clockwise.  This is a |command-button| command.

  rotateCounterclockwise ()

    Set the layer to the result of rotation of the layer 3π/2 radian
    clockwise.  This is a |command-button| command.

  setScale (number)

    Set the scale factor of the layer to the argument and set the
    layer to the scaled variant of the layer.

The |resize| event is fired at an |image-editor| or |image-layer|
element when it is initialized and whenever the its width or height
has been changed.

The |change| event is fired at an |image-layer| element when the
element is initialized and whenever the layer is set to a new image or
placeholder.
